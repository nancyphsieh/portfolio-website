		<p>Hi, my name is Nancy Hsieh. I am a graphic designer specializing in UI and Web Design. 
		I am a constant student, learning about art, culture, and nature. I am a continuous observer, looking for the subtle and the evocative. With this, I incorporate into thoughtful and creative designs. You will usually find me drinking tea, practicing yoga, in a museum, or admiring and creating beautiful typesetting in the beautiful city of San Francisco. 
		Why graphic design? I knew I was meant to be a graphic designer when I appreciated the signage as well as the science in the natural history museum, or chose a book not for its content but for its typesetting, or noticed a package at the store because its type and illustrations made it stand out on the shelf, or flipped through a magazine because the grid popped out with purpose on every page.
		As soon as I discovered what I appreciated was graphic design, I knew that that was the type of designer I wanted to be, and so I pursued it passionately. While in school, at The Academy of Art University, I worked in various design studios in the bay area, and I joined Hatch Studio immediately after graduation. My clients have included Coca-Cola, Apple, Specialty’s, Beringers, Fionna’s Candyshoppe, Hyphen Magazine, Sanitas Skincare, and Contemporary Austin. Being a constant student, I have also continued learning about printmaking, photography, designing for a magazine as well as a museum, front-end web development as well as UI/UX.
