						<h2>Project:<br>Online Plant Shop</h2>

						<p>Green+House makes buying plants easy by delivering healthy, ready-to-go plants to the door, and the tips and tricks one needs to help plants thrive. Plants make life better. So, they want to make plants easy. When someone buys a houseplant from a box store or nursery, it probably spends an average of four weeks traveling from a greenhouse to a drafty warehouse on a hot or cold truck. Then, it is shipped to a store where it likely isn’t getting the water, light, or care it needs to thrive. With Green+House, their plants are cared for by plant experts and kept in optimal conditions at their greenhouse where they’re shipped. So instead of the plant spending 4 weeks in an uncontrolled environment, it spends 3 to 4 days going from their greenhouse to the front door. This means plants arrive healthy and already thriving. Their plants are shipped with care and experience. They’ve learned how to keep plants at the right temperature, protect their roots, and keep them healthy while they travel from the greenhouse to the home. Their innovative packaging holds plants securely in place, preventing damage and decreasing soil spillage. Most shipments arrive in a week, and all plants will be healthy, and undamaged.</p>	

						<p class="spacephoto">Design Process:<br> Creating an identity from scratch begins with a clear brand strategy. Who are they, their purpose, what’s their personality, and the core idea? The core of Green+House was freshness, fresh from the greenhouse, and a fresh outlook on buying plants online. What are the parameters? For a new identity, it needs to represent the core idea in every aspect of its application, and stand out from the competition. A good logo is distinctive, appropriate, practical, graphic, and simple in form, and it conveys the owner's intended message. A concept or “meaning” is usually behind an effective logo, and it communicates the intended message. Designing the shape of a logomark to represent the earth, plants, and home is true to the company’s philosophy—a better home and a better earth is one with plants. Simply having a logo doesn’t guarantee the brand identity system is going to work for the company. A great brand identity is a system of elements working together to provide unity, consistency, and flexibility. With a flexible logo, it needs to be simple, work in color, or black and white, on screen, or on print. Color palettes can make an identity feel fresh and unique. A fresh green was selected first. Then, the complement, a red, a shade of green for contrast, a black for text or icons, and a neutral gray for balance. Typography must complement the logo and other design elements, and a secondary typographic option to provide contrast and hierarchy across various media. Lora is a well-balanced modern serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. The typographic voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an art essay. Lora is also optimized for screen appearance, and works equally well in print. The extended visual language of icons helps to increase flexibility. Designed to complement the typography and logomark, these symbols must be easy to see and decipher. Most importantly, the voice of Green+House must be full of hope and vitality.</p>
