						<h2>Project:<br>Book Subscription Web/App</h2>

						<p>Scribd is a company who believes that reading opens doors, and part of their mission is to change the way the world reads by providing a wide range of reading material in both print and audio formats at a price that is fair for both creators and consumers. Their ever-expanding library includes over a million full-length titles, ranging from widely-known bestsellers to niche titles and publications. In addition, they have over a hundred million documents, shared by Scribd’s community of users, about any and every topic you might be interested in. They publish new and experimental works in text and audio formats. Whether you like riveting non-fiction or racy romance, a quick read on your lunch break or a longer immersive experience, they’ve got something for you. Scribd uses a combination of editorial expertise, machine learning systems and search technologies to make it easy for you. Because they have a range of material, they can find the items that are connected. For example, if you are interested in a particular author, you can also read related articles and documents, listen to podcasts, or even relevant sheet music.</p>	

						<p class="spacephoto">Design Process:<br>Scribd needed a website redesign. When considering a redesign, there should always be a good reason behind it. Upon research, visitors came upon the site looking for documents. While on the website, studies showed if visitors stayed longer than 10 minutes, they were more likely to sign up for a free 30 day subscription. Company profits showed a business model with potential, but definitely room for improvement. Scribd needed to increase the number of visits and visitors, reduce bounce rate, increase time on site, improve domain authority, increase the total new leads and form submissions, and increase the total sales generated. Before crafting a new website design and content, they needed to be crystal clear about their desired branding, messaging, and unique value proposition. Doing so ensured consistency across their entire website. Anyone who visits Scribd for the first time should immediately see them as a company focused on reading and learning from a variety of resources which are not only easy to find but worth subscribing to. A new friendlier logo with an iconic symbol of an owl immediately placed an emphasis on knowledge. A brighter appearance, simpler navigation system with multiple tiers, and organized graphic elements invited visitors to stay and browse through this virtual library. Illustrations by the talented Gosia Herba paired perfectly with the typography, adding a playful twist to a library platform.</p>
